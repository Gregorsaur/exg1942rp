Following our investigation, it was found out that our own allies were the ones responsible for the assassination. Be assured that our vengeance will be swift, and proportionate.

Following our investigation, it was found out that our own allies were the ones responsible for the assassination. Be assured that our vengeance will be swift, and proportionate. This is nothing else, but an act of treason.
